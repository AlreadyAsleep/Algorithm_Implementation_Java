# Algorithm_Implementation_Java
A few implementations of common useful algorithms I've implemented in Java included with main methods for console testing.
 
<h3>BinarySearch</h3>
This class implements a common recursive binary search algorithm that a professor of mine gave to me.
It has a time complexity of O(logN) and a space complexity of O(N).
<h3>MergeSort</h3>
<a href=https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/merge_sort_algorithm.htm>This class implements a common mergesort algorithm that I found here.</a href>
<h3>Knapsack</h3>
This class implements a solution to the Knapsack problem with two dimensions.
<a href=https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/knapsackProblem.html>More about it can be read here.</a href>
My implementation uses an algorithm with a time complexity of O(2<sup>N</sup>) and a space complexity of O(Nk) where k is the max "wieght" of the Knapsack.
